# Schrift
## A clean and minimalist Jekyll template. Designed for prose. Simple to start with.

### Introduction to the style
I have often tried to design a weblog style that would focus on the content and would still be elegant and nice to look at. I don’t pretend I have achieved it yet. But here is my most recent attempt at it. I’m making this template for Jekyll available now. Please use and hack!

### Demo site
* **[schrift.schoewilliam.fr](http://schoewilliam.fr)**

### Configuration
Also, the idea being that it can be used as-is, I have included some options in the `_config.yml` file. This way one can start using the template very easily after cloning the repo.
Once done, you can run `jekyll build` and done !
